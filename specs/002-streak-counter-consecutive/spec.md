# Feature Specification: Streak Counter

**Feature Branch**: `002-streak-counter-consecutive`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Streak counter. Consecutive correct guesses add to streak counter, a single incorrect guess resets to zero. Have milestone markers at 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 100, at the milestones signal it in some way, maybe changed color streak counter and a emoji or small animation, open to suggestions."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Design for TDD**: Requirements must be written to support test-first development (clear inputs/outputs, observable behaviors)
5. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
   - Testable acceptance criteria

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: Should the streak counter persist across browser sessions (page refresh, closing/reopening the app)? ‚Üí A: Reset to 0 on every session start (ephemeral, in-memory only)
- Q: How long should the milestone celebration visual effects remain visible? ‚Üí A: Quick flash (<1 second) followed by permanent color change to milestone-specific color for rest of session
- Q: What visual elements should be included in the milestone celebration (beyond the color change)? ‚Üí A: Animation only (scale/pulse effect on the counter)
- Q: Should the system track and display the user's highest streak ever achieved? ‚Üí A: Yes, display "Best: X" alongside current streak
- Q: Should different milestone levels have different colors, or progressively intensifying shades? ‚Üí A: Distinct colors per milestone (e.g., 3=blue, 5=green, 10=purple, etc.)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user playing the guessing game wants to track their success through consecutive correct guesses. As they guess correctly multiple times in a row, their streak counter increases, motivating them to continue their success. The interface displays both their current streak and their best streak ever achieved. When they reach certain milestone achievements (3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 100 consecutive correct guesses), the interface celebrates their accomplishment with a quick animation and permanently changes the streak counter color to that milestone's distinct color. If they make an incorrect guess, their current streak resets to zero while their best streak record is preserved, and they start building their streak again from scratch. The streak counter resets to 0 at the start of each new session.

### Acceptance Scenarios
*Write scenarios that can be directly converted to tests (support TDD)*
1. **Given** the user has a streak of 0, **When** they make a correct guess, **Then** the streak counter increases to 1
2. **Given** the user has a streak of 5, **When** they make a correct guess, **Then** the streak counter increases to 6
3. **Given** the user has a streak of 10, **When** they make an incorrect guess, **Then** the streak counter resets to 0
4. **Given** the user reaches a streak of exactly 3, **When** the counter updates, **Then** a milestone celebration is displayed
5. **Given** the user reaches a streak of exactly 5, **When** the counter updates, **Then** a milestone celebration is displayed
6. **Given** the user reaches a streak of exactly 10, **When** the counter updates, **Then** a milestone celebration is displayed
7. **Given** the user reaches a streak of exactly 15, **When** the counter updates, **Then** a milestone celebration is displayed
8. **Given** the user reaches a streak of exactly 20, **When** the counter updates, **Then** a milestone celebration is displayed
9. **Given** the user reaches a streak of exactly 30, **When** the counter updates, **Then** a milestone celebration is displayed
10. **Given** the user reaches a streak of exactly 50, **When** the counter updates, **Then** a milestone celebration is displayed
11. **Given** the user reaches a streak of exactly 100, **When** the counter updates, **Then** a milestone celebration is displayed
12. **Given** the user has a streak of 7 (not a milestone), **When** they make a correct guess reaching 8, **Then** the counter increases without milestone celebration
13. **Given** the user reaches a milestone streak, **When** the celebration displays, **Then** a quick (<1 second) scale/pulse animation plays and the streak counter permanently changes to that milestone's distinct color
14. **Given** the user has achieved a streak of 10 in the current session, **When** they later achieve a streak of 7, **Then** the "Best: 10" display remains unchanged
15. **Given** the user closes and reopens the application, **When** the application loads, **Then** both current streak and best streak reset to 0
16. **Given** the user is viewing the streak counter, **When** the counter is displayed, **Then** both "Current: X" and "Best: Y" values are visible

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user makes multiple correct guesses in rapid succession? (System must accurately count each one)
- What happens when the user's streak is exactly at a milestone (e.g., 10) and they make another correct guess to 11? (No milestone celebration, just normal increment; milestone color persists)
- What happens when the game is closed and reopened? (Both current and best streak reset to 0; ephemeral session-only storage)
- What happens if the user reaches 100 and continues? (Continue counting beyond 100 with no additional milestones; retains milestone 100's color)
- What happens when current streak exceeds previous best? (Best streak updates immediately to match current streak)
- What invariants must hold? (Streak count must always be non-negative; streak must reset to exactly 0 on incorrect guess, not negative values; best streak >= current streak at session start, best streak >= current streak after any reset)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain a counter that tracks consecutive correct guesses, starting at 0 for each session
- **FR-002**: System MUST increment the current streak counter by 1 for each correct guess
- **FR-003**: System MUST reset the current streak counter to 0 when any incorrect guess is made
- **FR-004**: System MUST display both the current streak count and best streak count to the user at all times during gameplay (format: "Current: X" and "Best: Y")
- **FR-005**: System MUST recognize milestones at streak values: 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, and 100
- **FR-006**: System MUST trigger a milestone celebration when the current streak reaches any milestone value, consisting of a scale/pulse animation lasting less than 1 second
- **FR-007**: System MUST permanently change the streak counter display color to the milestone's distinct color after the celebration animation completes, persisting for the remainder of the session
- **FR-008**: System MUST assign a unique distinct color to each milestone level (e.g., 3=blue, 5=green, 10=purple, 15=orange, 20=red, 30=gold, 50=cyan, 100=magenta)
- **FR-009**: System MUST continue counting streak beyond 100 without additional milestone celebrations, retaining milestone 100's color
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure streak counter never displays negative values
- **FR-011**: System MUST reset both current streak and best streak to 0 at the start of each new session (no persistence across browser refresh or application restart)
- **FR-012**: System MUST track and update the best streak value, setting it to the current streak value whenever current streak exceeds the previous best streak
- **FR-013**: System MUST preserve the best streak value when the current streak resets due to an incorrect guess

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Streak State**: Represents the session's streak tracking data
  - Current count: non-negative integer (default: 0)
  - Best count: non-negative integer (default: 0)
  - Current milestone color: string representing the color of the highest milestone reached by current streak (null if no milestone reached)
  - Session-only storage (ephemeral, resets on page refresh)

- **Milestone Definition**: Static configuration for each milestone
  - Streak value: one of [3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 100]
  - Distinct color: unique color identifier per milestone
  - Animation type: scale/pulse effect (<1 second duration)
