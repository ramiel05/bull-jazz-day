# Feature Specification: Share Results

**Feature Branch**: `003-share-result`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "share results. a share button in the feedback display. it appear on both correct and incorrect guesses. it should be a simple copy to clipboard share, no browser share API is necessary. it should share the following information: the day in question, whether the day was fake or real, the players guess chosen, current streak, milestone if just achieved on that guess, new best streak if a new best streak was just achieved on that guess. have some emojis to reflect correct or wrong guess and any milestone reached. include a link to the deployed production site."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Design for TDD**: Requirements must be written to support test-first development (clear inputs/outputs, observable behaviors)
5. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
   - Testable acceptance criteria

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-07

- Q: What is the production site URL that should be included in shared messages? ‚Üí A: https://bull-jazz-day.vercel.app
- Q: What are the specific milestone thresholds that should be recognized and celebrated in shared messages? ‚Üí A: 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 100 (as defined in spec 002)
- Q: How should copy failure be communicated to the user when the clipboard API is unavailable or denied permission? ‚Üí A: Button text changes to "Copy failed" for 5 seconds, then reverts
- Q: When a player has a streak of 0 (first play or after reset), should the shared message include "Streak: 0" or omit the streak information entirely? ‚Üí A: Omit streak information entirely
- Q: How should the shared message be formatted to ensure readability across different platforms (mobile messaging, Twitter, Discord, etc.)? ‚Üí A: Plain text with line breaks between sections

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

After making a guess about whether a UN International Day is real or fake, users want to share their results with others. They click a share button to copy a formatted message to their clipboard that includes their guess outcome, streak information, any milestones achieved, and a link to the game, which they can then paste into social media, messaging apps, or anywhere else.

### Acceptance Scenarios

_Write scenarios that can be directly converted to tests (support TDD)_

1. **Given** a player has made a correct guess, **When** they click the share button in the feedback display, **Then** a formatted message is copied to their clipboard containing: the day name, correct real/fake designation, their correct guess, current streak, success emoji, and production site link

2. **Given** a player has made an incorrect guess, **When** they click the share button in the feedback display, **Then** a formatted message is copied to their clipboard containing: the day name, correct real/fake designation, their incorrect guess, failure emoji, and production site link. Streak information is omitted (as streak resets to 0 on incorrect guess).

3. **Given** a player with streak of 0 clicks the share button, **When** the message is copied, **Then** the shared message omits all streak information (no "Streak: 0" displayed)

4. **Given** a player achieves a milestone on their current guess, **When** they click the share button, **Then** the copied message includes the milestone achievement with celebratory emoji

5. **Given** a player achieves a new best streak on their current guess, **When** they click the share button, **Then** the copied message includes the new best streak information with celebratory emoji

6. **Given** the share button has been clicked, **When** the copy operation completes successfully, **Then** there is visual feedback to the user that the copy succeeded in the form of button text changing to "Copied!"

7. **Given** the share button has been clicked, **When** the copy operation fails (clipboard API unavailable or permission denied), **Then** the button text changes to "Copy failed" for 5 seconds before reverting to the original text

### Edge Cases

- Clipboard API unavailable or denied permission ‚Üí Button text changes to "Copy failed" for 5 seconds
- Player has streak of 0 (first play or after reset) ‚Üí Omit streak information from shared message
- Message formatting across platforms ‚Üí Plain text with line breaks between sections for cross-platform readability

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

- **FR-015**: System MUST allow unlimited shares, no rate limiting
- **FR-016**: System MUST display "Copy failed" button text for 5 seconds when clipboard copy operation fails, then revert to original button text
- **FR-017**: Shared message MUST be formatted as plain text with line breaks between sections to ensure readability across different platforms (mobile messaging, Twitter, Discord, etc.)

### Key Entities

- **Share Message**: The formatted text copied to clipboard (plain text with line breaks between sections)
  - Day name (string, from game state)
  - Day type (real or fake, from game state)
  - Player guess (real or fake, from game state)
  - Current streak (number, positive integer. Not included when current streak is 0)
  - Milestone text (string or null - null when no milestone achieved)
  - New best streak text (string or null - null when no new best achieved)
  - Emoji indicators (string, never empty - always includes guess result emoji)
  - Production site URL (string, constant: https://bull-jazz-day.vercel.app)
  - Format: Plain text with line breaks between sections for cross-platform compatibility
  - Style: Natural, conversational phrasing (e.g., "International Day of Peace is real!", "My guess: Real") rather than key-value format (e.g., "Day:", "Type:", "Your guess:")
