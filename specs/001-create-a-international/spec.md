# Feature Specification: International Day Guessing Game

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-international`
**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "create a international day of X guessing game. there are many real days like international women's day, earth day, etc. and there are many real days that are silly like international donut day. there are so many days now it is getting ridiculous. the game should have a pool of real and fake but plausible, sometimes just funny, fake days. visitors can guess if the day is real or fake. don't be over eager in adding extra features, keep the spec to be just this game, other obvious features can come in a later spec."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30
- Q: When a visitor refreshes the page mid-game, what should happen? → A: Start completely fresh - new random day, no memory of previous guesses
- Q: When a visitor has seen all days in the pool (played through everything), what should happen next? → A: Days repeat - allow seeing the same days again in random order
- Q: How large should the initial pool of days be (combined real + fake)? → A: Small starter set (~10-20 total days) for MVP
- Q: What makes an international day "real" for this game? → A: Any day with a Wikipedia entry or major organization backing
- Q: After revealing if a guess is correct/incorrect, should the game show additional information about the day? → A: Show date + brief description/context + source/reference link

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A visitor arrives at the game and is presented with an "International Day of X" name. They think about whether this sounds like a real internationally recognized day or a made-up one. They make their guess (real or fake), and the system immediately tells them if they were correct and reveals the truth. They can then continue to the next day to keep playing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
*Write scenarios that can be directly converted to tests (support TDD)*

1. **Given** a visitor loads the game, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see an international day name displayed with options to guess "Real" or "Fake"

2. **Given** a visitor sees "International Women's Day", **When** they select "Real", **Then** the system shows "Correct! This is a real international day" along with the date (March 8), a brief description, and a source/reference link

3. **Given** a visitor sees "International Sock Puppet Appreciation Day", **When** they select "Fake", **Then** the system shows "Correct! This day was made up" (assuming it's fake in the pool)

4. **Given** a visitor has just received feedback on their guess, **When** they choose to continue, **Then** the system presents a different international day

5. **Given** a visitor sees "International Donut Day", **When** they select "Fake" thinking it's too silly, **Then** the system shows "Incorrect! This is actually a real international day"

6. **Given** a visitor plays multiple rounds, **When** they continue to the next day, **Then** each day shown is randomly selected from the pool

### Edge Cases
- When the visitor has seen all days in the pool within a session, days can repeat and be shown again in random order (infinite gameplay).
- When the visitor refreshes the page, the game starts completely fresh with a new random day and no memory of previous guesses or game state.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display one international day name at a time to the visitor
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide two options for the visitor: "Real" and "Fake"
- **FR-003**: System MUST accept the visitor's guess (Real or Fake)
- **FR-004**: System MUST immediately show feedback indicating whether the guess was correct or incorrect
- **FR-005**: System MUST reveal the truth (whether the day is actually real or fake) after each guess, along with additional context: the actual date (for real days), a brief description, and a source/reference link
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a way for the visitor to continue to the next day after receiving feedback
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain a pool of real international days (both serious ones like International Women's Day and silly ones like International Donut Day) - initial MVP pool approximately 5-10 real days
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain a pool of fake but plausible international days (some plausible, some humorous) - initial MVP pool approximately 5-10 fake days
- **FR-009**: System MUST randomly select days from the combined pool of real and fake days (days may repeat after all have been seen)
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure each presented day includes enough context that it's recognizable (e.g., "International Day of X" format)
- **FR-011**: System MUST NOT persist game state across page refreshes (each refresh starts a completely new game session)

### Key Entities

- **International Day**: Represents a day entry in the game. Contains the day name (e.g., "International Women's Day", "International Donut Day", "International Procrastination Day"), whether it is real or fake, the actual date it occurs on (for real days, e.g., March 8 for International Women's Day), a brief description providing context, and a source/reference link (URL to Wikipedia, UN page, or organization backing the day). A "real" day is defined as any international day with a Wikipedia entry or backing from a major organization (UN, NGO, industry groups, etc.).
